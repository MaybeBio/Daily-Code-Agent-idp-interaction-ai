# _2026_streit_hx

This repository contains the experimental datasets, custom code, and analysis scripts associated with our study of hydrogen exchange (HX) forward models and their use in refining protein conformational ensembles. It covers both residue-resolved HX-NMR protection factors and peptide-resolved hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS).

Streit J.O., Peterle D., Tesei G., Invernizzi M., Bottaro S., Schulze T.K., Kunz P., Tamiola K., Lindorff-Larsen K. (2026). *Integrating hydrogen-exchange experiments with conformational ensembles*. **bioRxiv**. Link TBA.

## Repository structure

- **[`HDX_project/`](https://github.com/KULL-Centre/_2026_streit_hx/blob/HEAD/HDX_project/readme.md)** – HX-NMR forward-model benchmarking, parameter optimisation, and ensemble reweighting using experimental protection factors. Includes scripts and jupyter notebooks to process simulation datasets, experimental data and for analysis.
- **[`HDXMS/`](https://github.com/KULL-Centre/_2026_streit_hx/blob/HEAD/HDXMS/readme.md)** – HDX-MS forward-model benchmarking and ensemble reweighting. Includes scripts and jupyter notebooks to process simulation datasets, experimental data and for analysis.
- **`scripts_for_NMR_SAXS/`** – Scripts for analyses involving NMR (CS, RDC, PRE) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data.
- **`HDXproject_env.yml`** – Conda environment file.


## Getting started

### Setting up the Conda environment

The Python dependencies required for the analyses are specified in `HDXproject_env.yml`. 

From the root directory of this repository, create and activate the environment:

```bash
conda env create -f HDXproject_env.yml -n HDXproject
conda activate HDXproject
```

### Running the analyses

See the READMEs in [`HDX_project/`](https://github.com/KULL-Centre/_2026_streit_hx/blob/HEAD/HDX_project/readme.md) and [`HDXMS/`](https://github.com/KULL-Centre/_2026_streit_hx/blob/HEAD/HDXMS/readme.md) for their respective directory structures, input data, and analysis workflows.
