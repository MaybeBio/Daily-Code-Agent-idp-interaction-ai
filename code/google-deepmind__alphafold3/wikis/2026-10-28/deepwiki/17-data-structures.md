This document provides a technical overview of the key data structures used throughout the AlphaFold 3 system. It describes the transition from high-level biological input definitions to internal table-based structure representations and numerical feature tensors.

## Overview of Data Flow

The AlphaFold 3 pipeline transforms data through several distinct representations, starting from a user-defined JSON input and ending with a 3D structure and associated confidence metrics.

```mermaid

    subgraph "NaturalLanguageSpace"
        JSON["User JSON Input"]
    end

    subgraph "CodeEntitySpace"
        JSON --> FoldingInput["alphafold3.common.folding_input.Input"]
        FoldingInput --> Structure["alphafold3.structure.structure.Structure"]
        Structure --> TableBase["structure_tables / Table-based Storage"]
        TableBase --> Featurization["alphafold3.model.features (AtomLayout, MSA, Templates)"]
        Featurization --> Model["Model Inference & BatchDict"]
    end
```

## Input Data Model

The primary entry point for the system is the `Input` class. This dataclass acts as a container for the biological entities being modeled, organized into various chain types. The system supports multiple JSON dialects, including the standard `alphafold3` dialect and the `alphafoldserver` dialect [src/alphafold3/common/folding_input.py:38-43]().

For details, see [Input Data Model](#5.1).

## Structure Representation

AlphaFold 3 uses a table-based `Structure` class to manage 3D coordinates and chemical metadata. This representation is designed for efficient filtering and manipulation of large molecular systems by leveraging NumPy-backed tables [src/alphafold3/structure/structure.py:341-450]().

### Code Entity Association: Structure Tables

The following diagram maps structural concepts to specific Python classes and their underlying table layouts.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Structure {
        +dict atom_x
        +dict atom_y
        +dict atom_z
        +dict bonds
    }
    class Atoms {
        +ndarray x
        +ndarray y
        +ndarray z
        +ndarray element
    }
    class Residues {
        +ndarray id
        +ndarray name
        +ndarray auth_seq_id
    }
    class Chains {
        +ndarray chain_id
        +ndarray asym_id
        +ndarray entity_id
    }
    Structure *-- Atoms
    Structure *-- Residues
    Structure *-- Chains
    Chains --> _compute_asym_entity_and_sym_id : "alphafold3.model.features"
```

## Feature Tensors

Before being processed by the neural network, biological data is converted into numerical tensors. This featurization process maps irregular biological structures onto fixed-size arrays managed by `AtomLayout` and packaged into dictionary structures (`BatchDict`) [src/alphafold3/model/features.py:39-53]().

For details, see [Feature Tensors](#5.3).

## Confidence Metrics

The final output of the model includes several metrics used to assess the reliability of the predicted 3D structure. These metrics are calculated during post-processing and include pLDDT, pTM, ipTM, PAE, and PDE.

For details, see [Confidence Metrics](#5.4).

Sources: [src/alphafold3/common/folding_input.py:11-40]()

## Chemical Components and Constants

Handling chemical components relies heavily on the Chemical Components Dictionary (CCD) database, managing bond stereochemistry, atom types, and standard residue definitions.

For details, see [Chemical Components and Constants](#5.5).
